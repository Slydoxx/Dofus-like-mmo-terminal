Here’s a tight, high‑impact next slice:
Combat polish
Turn strip (You → Enemy), AP/MP bars, ability tooltips (cost/tags/range)
Hover LoS/range preview per selected ability
Path highlight + invalid target feedback
Equip UX
Slot highlighting on hover; reject glow + shake on invalid drops
Right‑click to unequip to inventory; show equipped tag in inventory
Dialogue system
Load dialogues from JSON (id → lines, choices); same bubble UI
Branching choices (accept/decline), simple variables (e.g., hasMetNPC)
Merchant flow
Prices/affixes in list; confirm dialog for expensive buys
Proper sell panel (not reusing inventory), multi‑sell with quantity selector
Profile/inventory QoL
Drag from profile back to inventory; stack awareness
Tabs in profile (Stats, Equipment, Skills); basic keybind hints inside panels
Persistence
Save/Load (player, equipped, inventory, gold, progression, npcs flags)
Settings: fullscreen, volume, zoom speed
Tests (quick)
Inventory stacking/splitting; equip swap; ability registry per weapon type
Recommended order: Combat polish → Equip UX highlights → Dialogue from JSON → Merchant sell panel → Save/Load → Tests.
Say go for “Combat polish,” and I’ll implement: turn strip, ability tooltips, and clearer LoS/range/path feedback.
